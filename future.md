One potential optimization not currently performed is the removal of CheckPlayer.js entirely. It would significantly reduce the size of the code (20k in the original source, 18k here). CheckPlayer walks a user through installing Flash for the first time if they don't have it installed. Since the number of fresh IE6 installations without Flash installed is likely astonishingly low, CheckPlayer arguably offers no value. In addition, CheckPlayer doesn't work very well for this use case. Since Flash is just being used as a hack to cross domain boundaries, there is no visible UI. If an IE6 user doesn't have Flash installed, a small box appears with a UI asking the user to install Flash. When they choose to do so, the UI shows a progress bar and appears to install Flash - but IE6 requires a restart to accept the installation. Arguably you've already lost this user from your site - redirecting the user to http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/ is simpler (far less code) and will walk the user more clearly through the install steps, including closing all browser windows to continue. Whether the answer is to simplify the process or remove it entirely, certainly the code currently spent on this process is of low value.
